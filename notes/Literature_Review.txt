Crohn's overview: 26 to 201 cases per 100,000; 14.6 cases per 100,000 person-years

-medical intervention is the primary treatment option for most patiends with Crosh's disease

-invasive surgery where resection of the colon is common

-economic burden estimated to be between $2.0 - $18.2 billion per year (11,898-23,014 per patient, adjusted to 2015) not using MEPS (4-7)

-Using MEPS data from 1996-2009, annual cost was $10,354 per patient with Crohn's disease, and $2.5 billion per year (8)

-a large proportion of health care expenditures for Crohn’s disease were historically due to inpatient expenses (e.g., surgi- cal resection of colon). In a report by Gibson (6), gastrointestinal surgery was associated with a large proportion of the costs compared to patients without surgery ($60,147 versus $15,698, P < 0.01) despite only occurring in 7.4% of the Crohn’s disease population.

-recent shift from inpatient setting to the prescription setting due to the improvements associated with the introduction of biologics (3)

-The introduction of infliximab in 1999 as the first tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor for Crohn’s disease, pro- vided rapid and long term remission delaying or preventing surgical interventions. 

-However, inflix- imab is delivered by infusion, which may have limited uptake of infliximab treatment as a standard of practice. In

-In 2008, FDA approved two self-injectable biologics (adalimumab and certolizumab pegol) for treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease

-In 2012 FDA approved vedolizumab for a similar indication

-Only subjects with full data were incorporated into the model

-two-part generalized linear model:
--logit model to estimate the likelihood of having nonzero health care expenditures
--GLM with power-link and gamma distribution to estimate association between Crohn's and various health care expenditures

-95% confidence intervls from 1000 bootstrapped samples using method of recycled predictions

-Model specification was assessed with Pearson correlations between residuals andpredicted expenditures and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests

-Annual mean health care expenditures pre-post FDA approvals of new biologics and the American College of Gastroenterology Crohn’s disease treatment guidelines were compared using difference-in-differences estimation based on linear regression using strategy from: Van der Valk ME,Mangen M-JJ, Leenders M, et al. Healthcare costs of inflammatory bowel disease have shifted from hospitalisation and surgery towards anti-TNFa therapy: results from the COIN study. Gut 2014;63:72–79
--showed that respondents with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease had a higher increase in total expenditures from baseline compared to those without
